## Pokemon_RL
Training an agent to play simplified version of pokemon using reinforcement learning. The current implementation uses an epsilon-greedy exploration strategy but in the future thomson sampling might also be added for comparison. The current implementation also uses a handcrafted policy for the agent to play against, but a MCTS might also be added so the agent learns to play against a more dynamic opponent.
